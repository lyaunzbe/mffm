###Install

> All you need to get started is git/node/npm.

    git clone https://github.com/jordwalke/reactapp
    cd reactapp
    npm install                 # install dependencies.



### Run and Build on the Fly

>  Just hit your browser's refresh button to run an always-up-to-date version of your app.

    node lib/server/serverMain.js
    open http://localhost:8080                     # App rendered on the client.
    open http://localhost:8080/index.server.html   # App rendered on the server.

- Dynamically packages/compiles your app on each server request.


###Structure

> `reactapp` is a basic structure for you app and development environment.

          │   └── Widget.jsx        # A View style component.

          └── server                # server-only code
              └── serverMain.jsx


### Create Your UI:

- `reactapp` allows you to require `JSX` files when rendering on either the client or the server.
  - `var Widget = require('./Widget.jsx');`
- `reactapp` considers the `lib/app/Application.jsx` to be your main entry point
component. Start by editing that file to create your user experience.
- Add your own component directory structure inside of `lib/app/` to your liking.
- Build up an applications by composing lower level components into more sophisticated components.



### Build For Production or Sharing
> Pre-Build your app for use on CDN, or to allow your committed project to be
> effeciantly loaded without a server/build-step.

        sudo npm install -g browserify
        ./offlineBuild.sh  # Output build/build.js is included in index.html
        open index.html    # No server needed now!

You may wish to run `offlineBuild.sh` before you push your branch to a public
 repo, so that others can easily download and try your app without having to set
 up a toolchain. `./offlineBuild.sh` will create a "one-click" demoable package
 for anyone to try in any browser - they only need to open `index.html` on their
 local file system.
 (If you have a purely client side app (no server side data fetching) this will "just work").


**Possible Add-Ons**:
  - Reload/rerender modules as you type in text editor (only the ones that changed).
  - Reload style without page refresh as style files change.
